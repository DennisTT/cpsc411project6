<h1>CPSC 411 - Stage 6: Register Allocation</h1>
<p>In
this stage of the project we are doing the work described
in Chapter 11 and 12 of the book. The goal of this stage is to finish the compiler, so that we can produce actually working
X86 assembly code. To achieve this goal there is one major chunk of
work remaining to be done: register allocation. Register allocation is
described in Chapter 11 of the book. There are also some
smaller odds and ends to be done to tie everything together and get the
code to run. This corresponds to Chapter 12 of the book.</p><h2>Project Setup</h2><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Warning:</span>
Before installing the new files, it is advisable to make a backup copy of
your project. Otherwise you run the risk of overwriting any
changes you have made to some of the files that were provided in phases
1 and 2.</p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,'sans serif';">If you
forgot how to import project files into Eclipse, please refer to one of the
previous readme.html files.</span></p><p>The project contains the same files

As it turns out, we did not seem to have explicit tests for the boolean
not (!) operator, and some students had solutions with incorrect
implementations of not. This was hard to figure out however since this
problem only surfaced when running the larger sample code tests which
are rather complex to debug.</p><h2>Inheritance</h2><p>The
implementation of inheritance in MiniJava is optional. We may come back
to this later if we have time to cover the material from Chapter 14 of
the textbook. You may attempt to implement inheritance support if you like an extra challenge.</p><ul><ul><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,'sans serif';"></span></ul></ul>

<h2>How to get started</h2><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,'sans serif';"></span><p>
There is a pretty good chance that X86 assembly code produced by
your stage 4 code generator is not entirely correct (because we did not
have a good way of testing the generated code, which contains
"fictional Temp registers"). You should expect to spend some time
debugging earlier stages in this final stage of the project. The
following sequence of steps is recommended to get you&nbsp;debugging
things as early as possible.</p><h3>Step 0: Reading</h3><p>Read chapters 11
and 12 of the book as well as the lecture slides on register
allocation.</p><h3>Step 1: Incorporate our Register Allocator</h3><p>
Test the allocator that we've provided with TestRegalloc. 
</p><h3>Step 2: Make it run (and debug)</h3><p>When
you have this working, you can fill in all the gaps, until you can
actually assemble, link and run the generated code (i.e. run <span style="font-weight: bold;">TestRunning.java</span>). You will probably
have to go back and do some debugging of prior stages such as the
translator, analysis and X86 code generator. 

You should also replace your provisional implementation of <span
style="font-weight: bold;">procEntryExit1</span> 
(from Step 1). Your new implementation should save and restore caller
save registers by moving them into and out of&nbsp;fresh Temps (thus
relying on the register allocator to spill these Temps into the Frame
on an as&nbsp;needed basis).</p>
</p><h2>Handing In</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Note: Some changes were made to the handin build.xml for this stage.<span style="color: black;"> </span></span><span style="color: black;">The changes relate to text highlighted in red below!</span></p><p>Only one of the team members should hand in for your team. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Make sure you have filled in the names of each team member in the src/README_stage6.txt file</span>. </p><p>The name of this project stage for the electronic handin is <b>
project6</b>. Please use the <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/ugrad/facilities/windows/handin.shtml">handin
web-interface</a>.</p>
<p>You should handin the entire contents of your project's src
directory, excluding the test files. <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">You should also handin the contents of the "runtime" directory, which contains some C source code for the runtime library.</span>
This is so that you could also make changes to the runtime library
should you wish to do so (for example, because you decided to implement
inheritance support).</p><p>We have provided a <span style="font-weight:
bold;">build.xml</span> script in the src directory that packages up the
correct files in a .zip file. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Please use
this script</span>, it will ensure a uniform layout for all handed in
materials, which makes it easier for the TA.</p>
